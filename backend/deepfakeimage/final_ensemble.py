"""
final_ensemble.py
------------------
FINAL, STABLE prediction pipeline. Combines all three models trained during
this project:

  forensics_model.joblib           - CIFAKE, 8 features, whole-image
  forensics_model_whatsapp.joblib  - 140k Faces + WhatsApp-sim, 8 features, whole-image
  forensics_model_v3.joblib        - 140k Faces + face-crop + filter-augmented, 10 features

Each model is automatically routed to the feature extractor it was actually
trained on (checked via feature count), then all available models are
averaged. An UNCERTAIN band is used instead of forcing every image into a
confident real/fake call — this is a deliberate design choice, not a
limitation being hidden: for a pre-triage tool, an honest "needs human
review" is more useful than a confident wrong answer.

Do NOT further hand-tune weights based on individual test photos — this
was tried during development and made things WORSE on some images while
improving others. Treat this ensemble as the stable final version.
